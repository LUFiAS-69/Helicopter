## Version

Unity 21.3.12f1 (LTS)


## Documentation

I've used two types of controllers for the helicopter. One uses "transform" to make the helicopter move, and the other one uses "rigidbody."


## Controls

The helicopter is controlled using simple and kid-friendly controls:

**W / Up Arrow:** Move/Tilt forward.\
**S / Down Arrow:** Move/Tilt backward.\
**A / Left Arrow:** Rotate/Tilt left.\
**D / Right Arrow:** Rotate/Tilt right.\
**E:** Increase altitude (fly up)\
**Q:** Decrease altitude (fly down).
